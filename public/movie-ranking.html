<hr />

<h3>Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>A fantastic 3d-animated movie utilizing multiple animation styles and techniques to create a unique experience.</p>

<h3>Equalizer 3</h3>
<p>An action packed movie with a pretty decent story in my opinion</p>

<h3>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</h3>
<p>A solid take on an old animated series from the 1990s. Had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.</p>
